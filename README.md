# Money Projections

Welcome to **Money Projections**. This site was created as a final 
project for Code Louisville's Front End Web Developement Course 
which incorporates a number of features in **HTML**, **CSS**, 
and **Javascript**.

The purpose of this project is to calculate different financial
aspects that can be used to better estimate income.

Below are the features picked from a list to be displayed for 
demonstrating understanding of the basics of front end developement
utilizing a mobile first approach.

##CSS Feature
* __CSS Grid and Flexbox__ to organize content.

##Javascript Features
*__Create a form__ validate at least one field and use that 
information on your page.

displays the results on your web page.

display that somewhere on your page.
*__Show/hide 1+ content areas__ or elements on your site 
through clicking a button or other user interaction.

Two break points are utilized to improve the site usability 
for tablets and desktops with mobile size as a base.

and covers 4 of the top 5 (the one not covered is on the 
list twice and landscape works).

_Laptop size goes from the largest resolution out of tablets, 
which is also the lowest of the most popular resolutions._
